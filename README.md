# Social-Network-Analysis-Platform
The Social Network Analysis Platform is a web application designed to efficiently analyse and visualise social network data sourced from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. In particular, we make use of the dataset collected from the Facebook application. The platform allows users to identify patterns and run queries (described in detail later) on the database, offering valuable insights serving commercial purposes.
